# Analysis of macrophage enhancers in response to IL-4
This repository includes codes associated with analysis on the sequencing data for macrophages in response to IL-4. 

## Training deep neural networks
The codes and data for training and evaluating neural networks are stored in [model_training/](https://github.com/zeyang-shen/macrophage_IL4Response/model_training)

The well-trained models used in our analysis are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R0DTxLh9KnejTSo7ugaz2TzxAucVEdeV?usp=sharing).
